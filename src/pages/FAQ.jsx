      answer:
        "After completing 120 hours of service, you earn an additional 10 marks. Complete 240 hours, and you’ll receive a National-level certificate with our emblem, which is great for placements and higher studies, making you stand out from the crowd. 🎓✨",

      question:
        "What’s the difference between a Volunteer and a Co-com member?",
